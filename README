3.Found generate file in scripts folder, example "MonitorListClass.java"
4.Run btrace with process and this generated java file.

How can I create my own json file?
You need to change this fields.
monitor-class
	gen-script-class-name : generated java file name in scripts folder
	print-interval : prints result for every specified interval, milliseconds
monitor-targets
	display-name : the output name of the target method 
	target-class-name : class name with package
	target-method-name : method name

DON'T change the fields list below, unless you know what you're doing.
template-file-name : specify the template file for generate java file
replacement-map-list : pre-defined name in java file generation
